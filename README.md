ðŸŽ¨ Extracting Dominant Hues with KMeans Clustering

This project focuses on identifying and displaying the dominant hues in an image using the KMeans clustering algorithm â€” a well-known unsupervised machine learning technique. It serves as a powerful tool for generating color palettes, summarizing image themes, and supporting visual design processes.

ðŸ“Œ Project Goal

To automatically extract the most prominent hues from input images. This aids in design automation, content labeling, and visual data insights. The project demonstrates the effective use of unsupervised learning in image analysis.

ðŸ§° Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (KMeans)
